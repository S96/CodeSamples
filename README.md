# CodeSamples
Random code samples from multiple projects

This repository contains code samples from a variety of projects, primarily in C++ and C#.

OmegaRace - net code from a network port of an existing project game that was originally not made to be networked later.

ModelTools - Basic model creation used as part of a dx11 renderer, but will probably find it's way into ForgeVk. Sphere is the interesting one there.

DeltA Engine - Excerpt from generative terrain system that was deformable by in game events and collisions and could display 4 height based texture regions as well as a special texture applied to deformed areas that blended into the surrounding textures.

SIMD Math Library - written as an optimized math library employing SIMD operations and proxy objects
